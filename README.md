# Variety of scripts

### This repository contains scripts that I have used for different purposes.

1. The **cisco-switch-scripts** are useful for managing infrastructures that heavily rely on cisco products.
2. The **mac-changer** script can be useful if don't want to install a third party software that would do the job.
