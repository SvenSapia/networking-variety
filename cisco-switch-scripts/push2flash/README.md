# Push image to switch

This script can be useful for a large number of cisco (catalyst) switches with similiar configuration images.

Configure one switch, make a backup of the bin file and use this script to push the binfile to multiple switches.

I have used this script a few years ago for a networking role I've had due to its simple syntax.
