# Cisco switch 802.1X authentication

To protect and monitor network ports companies may implement 802.1x to authenticate & authorize connected devices/users.
The script enables the cisco switches to communicate to radius servers on specific ports.
Radius servers have to be configured accordingly. Furthermore, 802.1x will only be enabled once the switch ports have been configured.
